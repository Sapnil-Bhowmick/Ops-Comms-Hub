# A Small Note From My Side !!!  
  Due to time constraints and my current job schedule, I couldn't implement all the features as planned. 
  However, I’ve tried to cover the basics with clean code, validations, and a solid structure. 
  Integrations are left to be implemented.
  There is a lot of scope for improvements in terms of features, performance, and structure. 
  
  I've focused on building a clean, modular code with robust validations and logical structuring.
